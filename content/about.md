I don’t particularly enjoy writing about myself. 

Do I write in third person about myself and come off as just another boring back to a book jacket blurb, designed to sell, doomed to be skimmed and forgotten moments later?

Scott is an Armenian American writer born and raised in the United States, specifically Salt Lake City, Utah. His dad, Harry, was a first-generation immigrant who, like many came to the United States for opportunity and to escape conflict…

How can I give an honest breakdown and share truth about who I am to someone who doesn’t know me, how do you know my reliability as a self-narrator?

If you are at this page and are screaming “SCOTT, I came to this page to figure out how to contact you, not for musings about how reliable autobiographies can really be.” To this I say, that’s fair, email me at scott@scottbasmadjian.com.

To everyone else, if for whatever reason, you want to know more about me. The best way to learn about me is to read this site along with my other works. They will tell you far more about me, who I actually am as a person, than an about me page could ever muster.
